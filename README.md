# i-am-bored

Simple page I made for #100Devs using <www.boredapi.com>. 

Use it [here](https://king-oldmate.github.io/i-am-bored/)

## How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

I used Visual Studio Code and a little bit of trial and error. It was a good api to work with and I'm pleased with the result. 

## Optimisations:

Originally I used `fetch()`, but after learning about `async/await` I implemented that instead. I think I overused `switch/case` but I prefer the aesthetics of it. 

I'm not pleased with the `try..catch` - something about it just feels off to me, since I know there are other ways to account for errors. I do think that this is something I can improve upon. 

## Lessons learned: 

I wish there were more *Eureka* moments here but with a great API and a simple implementation I suppose what I've learnt is that making little neat things like this is fun.
